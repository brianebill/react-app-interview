### Craft Demonstration (CD): 1 hour

The entire interview team attends the Craft Demonstration. The candidate will be asked to demonstrate their web development talent by implementing an application based upon provided requirements. This craft demonstration is based upon requirements that could very well be implemented on the job.

### Introduction

The candidate makes introductions and gives us a personal as well as professional background. Candidate should spend the majority of the time detailing their professional background.

### Exercise Requirements

You’ve been given the task of developing an Interview Wizard Application (IWA). The purpose of the IWA is to ask people one or more questions in order to learn more about them. The expectation is that each question is displayed on its own screen inside the wizard. In addition, it is also expected that the wizard can be embedded on a page easily in widget-type form; thus, this widget must assume that it can’t control the page that it’s on. After the user has answered all questions, all answers should be displayed to the user (this will be known as the “display screen”). After the user has navigated to the screen following the display screen, all questions and user answers should be persisted via a provided API. The following are specific requirements:

1. Coding:
  a. It is highly suggested to use the React JS framework
  b. A CSS pre-processor can be used, but it’s not required (e,g, Less, Sass)
  c. Must be mobile responsive

2.How it should work:
  a. Ask three questions, one question per wizard screen
  b. The question ordering should be easy to change
  c. Each question in the wizard should display one of the provided images
